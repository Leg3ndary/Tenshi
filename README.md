# Future
This is now a singular project that I will likely not be releasing to the public... Why?

Discord.py as a library has been depreceated making most of the bot actually useless as I will not be able to implement slash commands without rewriting the entire bot. Again.

Therefore this will just now be a side project that I work on for fun.

It's been a fun learning experience and I thank Danny the library dev for the wrapper but this is it for Tenshi.

# Tenshi Bot
I highly **do not** recommend hosting this bot yourself.
