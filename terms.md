### Last updated on 2021-07-22

Terms of Service for the discord bot Tenshi are as follows, these may change with no warning, or prior consent, it is the users responsibility to check often for any updates.

All breaking changes that add a new way data is collected/tracked (messages sent, command usage) or such, however will be announced in our [Discord Server (NOT DONE)](https://changeplease.com)

"Service" and "bot" shall mean the Discord Bot Tenshi, "We", "Tenshi" and "I" shall mean the developers "You" shall mean the user using this service.

## 1. Punishments
We reserve the right to ban any account we see fit, for whatever reason without any warning or specified reason. The service will attempt to contact you once through discord direct messages, we take no responsibility if you do not receive that message.

- Note almost 100% of the time banned accounts will be banned for a reason.

## 2. Macros
We do not condone any usage of macros, macros being anything that allows you to automate sending messages without having to press certain keys.

Examples are an auto message sending bot that runs commands for you, a bot that automatically types things for you.

Examples of **non macros** are copy pasting and sending, rebinding keys on your keyboard to different keys.

This is already covered in Discord TOS, any violations will be punished accordingly.

## 3. Exploits
Exploits are considered to be anything that allows a user to gain something unfairly or in an unreasonable manner.

All exploits should immediately be reported to us through our Discord Server.

Spreading or using exploits will be a permanent ban from the bot.

## 4. Hateful Language
Using our bot in any way to be racist, homophobic etc. will result in a permanent ban from the service. We do not and will never tolerate anything related to it. 

You'll also likely be reported to discord.

## 5. Privacy
When using our service, you consent to the following data being tracked (Please remember this is subject to change).

1. Commands used
- We will track any messages that use a command that our bot responds too
    - This is purely for performance/insights on what commands our users like to use.

# FAQ
- What happens if we don't get a Direct Message showing the reason for my punishment?

Rarely will we ever ban an account on accident, if you didn't receive a reason you'll have to guess.

- What happens if I find an exploit but keep quiet about it?

It would be great if you could help us fix it by reporting it, however you are under no obligation to do so. **However** if any evidence points to you spreading this to other users you will also be banned.
